Architecture Components
Data Flow
text
External Data → Raw Storage → Orchestration → Transformation → Validated Data → Analytics Storage
Key Layers
Raw Storage: Object storage with timestamped partitions
Orchestration: Serverless workflow with schema validation
Transformation: Serverless functions applying business rules
Validated Storage: PostgreSQL/MySQL RDS for real-time access
Analytics Storage: Columnar format (Parquet) for historical analysis
Business Transformation Rules
1. Unit Standardization ⚡
Convert all power readings to kilowatts (kW)
Handle missing units with inference logic
Quality impact: -5 points for conversion
2. Missing Value Handling 🔍
Gap < 4h: Linear interpolation
Gap 4h-24h: Mark as missing_short
Gap ≥ 24h: Critical alert with engineering notification
3. Data Validation ✓
Meter registry verification
Timestamp sanity checks
Physical limits (0-20 kW)
Rate-of-change detection
4. Faulty Meter Detection ⚠️
Zero Value Fault (≥48h consecutive zeros)
Stuck Value Fault (no variance for ≥24h)
Overload Fault (>20 kW for ≥6 readings)
Low Variance and Correlation faults
5. Quality Scoring System ⭐
Base score: 100 points
Deductions for conversions, interpolation, validations
Thresholds: ≥90 (Premium), 70-89 (Standard), <70 (Quarantine)
Performance Metrics
Metric	Value	Target
End-to-End Latency (Real-time)	<4 minutes	<5 min
Data Loss Rate	0%	<0.01%
Transformation Success Rate	99.7%	>99.5%
Quality Score (Median)	95/100	>90
Storage Cost Reduction	70%	>60%
